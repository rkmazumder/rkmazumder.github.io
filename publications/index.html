            Buried water pipelines suffer extensive damages when subjected to earthquake loading. Probable seismic damage of buried pipelines is typically estimated based on empirical analyses, where the effects of corrosion deterioration are often neglected. Corrosion induced deterioration weakens the pipeline resistance capacity, which in turn significantly reduces the seismic reliability of water distribution systems (WDS). Improved seismic damage estimation of buried water pipelines needs to consider the effect of corrosion on their seismic performance to assist with the development of an effective and efficient renewal strategy. Hence, the first part of this study improves the American Lifeline Alliance (ALA) 2001 guideline on seismic repair rate (RR) estimation, based on the observed effects of corrosion on pipeline damages during a recent earthquake (2014 Napa Earthquake). Then a renewal strategy is proposed that addresses the vulnerability of pipelines from the topological viewpoint in addition to the condition index and failure impact index commonly used in practice decisions. In addition, water distribution networks are often large and complex, which leads to considerable computational time and cost for seismic risk assessment. In this study, a computationally efficient methodology using python-based open-source libraries named SeismoPi is developed for estimating the seismic damage of buried pipelines. The methodology is capable of performing scenario-based seismic damage analysis of complex buried water networks, identifying critical segments and system connectivity, and estimating the renewal cost. The method presents the interactive outputs on OpenStreetMap so that decision-makers can easily visualize the results and identify the riskiest segments that need to be rehabilitated. SeismoPi assists decision-makers in developing WDS renewable strategies that account for the effects of corrosion deterioration on their seismic performance.  Applications of the proposed framework are demonstrated on a few small to large-sized water distribution systems.

            Coastal districts of Bangladesh are increasingly suffering from climatic hazards (e.g., cyclone, flood, saltwater intrusion). Tropical cyclones and floods particularly affect millions of people almost every year. Massive property damages and life losses are a common scenario when these disasters hit the coastal belt. Moreover, due to climate change impact, saltwater intrusion is increasing significantly in the coastal districts, especially during dry seasons impacting crop production and drinking water sources. The amount of asset and population exposed to natural hazards have increased significantly in the coastal belt, which has exacerbated the risk of natural hazards. Previous studies on the disaster risk of coastal districts of Bangladesh did not explicitly account for the key vulnerability and lack of coping capacity parameters that are crucial for a comprehensive risk assessment. This study assesses the disaster risk of 19 coastal districts of Bangladesh using the Index for Risk Management (INFORM) model. The multi-layered INFORM framework particularly assesses the risk of coastal communities considering socioeconomic vulnerabilities and vulnerable groups as well as institutional and infrastructural coping capacity under multiple hazards. Forty-five core risk indicators are used to evaluate the final risk score of the communities. The outcome of the study shows that 11 districts are facing moderate to very high level of risk in the coastal belt. The island district, Bhola, has the highest level of risk among the coastal districts, whereas Cox's Bazar, Chandpur, and Feni districts fall into the lowest risk region. In addition to hazard susceptibility, poverty & development, vulnerable health condition and access to the health care system are key vulnerable factors that potentially increase the overall risk. The outcome of this study is expected to be useful for preparing an effective disaster risk mitigation plan by decision-makers.

            Buried water pipelines are subjected to corrosion deterioration and are vulnerable to extreme events (e.g. earthquakes). Corroded metallic buried pipelines have experienced severe damage during past earthquakes resulting in the service disruption of Water Distribution System (WDS). Also, continuous and adequate water supply is imperative for fighting fires caused by the earthquakes. Therefore, evaluation of the functionality of WDS and its service restoration after an earthquake is very important for the water service provider as well as the communities.  This paper presents a framework to evaluate both component-level and system-level seismic risk and resilience of WDSs considering time-variant corrosion of pipelines. The vulnerability of individual pipelines is modelled by modifying the American Lifelines Alliance (ALA) pipeline vulnerability functions to explicitly account for the strength deterioration due to corrosion. Resilience is modelled using a functionality curve that relates system failure probability and repair activities over time. Probabilistic Functionality Fragility Surface (FFS) is developed for both components and system, by integrating the fragility curves and the restoration functions. The use of the proposed framework is demonstrated on two hypothetical water networks (i.e., one small scale and one medium scale).  The results of the two case studies show that the restoration process has a significant influence on the shape of the FFS.  Time to repair a break, number of breaks, network topology, the level of corrosion, and the available resources of utility companies are key parameters that determine the shape of the FFS. It is also observed that larger and older WDS networks experience a significantly higher number of breaks, which compromises their resilience. The proposed framework provides a useful planning tool for asset management of WDSs subjected to seismic hazards.

            Water distribution systems (WDS) are among the most essential infrastructure systems for the sustenance of societies. Therefore, their continued reliability is of utmost importance. However, the reliability of WDSs decreases over time due to aging and deterioration of components, especially pipelines. Metallic pipes are subject to external and internal corrosion overtime, which can significantly affect their mechanical strength and hydraulic performance and, consequently, WDS reliability. Existing research on system reliability is typically based on statistical failure prediction of pipelines, which, however, typically assumes a constant failure rate, thereby ignoring time-dependent strength deterioration due to corrosion. This paper proposes a framework for modeling the time-dependent reliability of WDSs with cast iron pipes considering both mechanical and hydraulic reliabilities. Time-dependent failure of pipelines is evaluated through a fragility analysis that considers the decrease of wall thickness over time due to corrosion. The impact of internal corrosion on hydraulic performance is also accounted for with a time-dependent roughness model. A notional WDS is used to demonstrate the proposed framework. The results of the case study show that pipe corrosion can significantly impact the reliability of a WDS as it ages. The proposed framework links the deterioration of pipeline strength and hydraulic performance with system reliability and can, therefore, form the basis of a reliability-based plan for maintenance and rehabilitation.

            Water distribution systems (WDS) are among the most critical civil infrastructure systems. A reliable and safe water supply is essential for the prosperity and continued well-being of society. Hence, adequate maintenance, repair, and renewal of the vast physical assets in WDS are of paramount importance, especially in places with widespread deterioration of critical water infrastructure assets. However, due to limited resources, water utilities struggle for their asset management strategies to keep pace with the aging of components. Recently, utilities have made efforts to refine the traditional condition-based approach to pipeline asset management that focuses on maintaining the current condition of assets into a service-based approach in which system performance is explicitly considered. This paper reviews existing literature on the various aspects of asset management of WDS, focusing specifically on buried pipelines. Existing condition assessment (CA) techniques, failure prediction models, time-dependent vulnerability models, maintenance planning strategies, and renewal techniques are reviewed. Various techniques of modeling WDS performance, as well as its interdependence with other infrastructure systems, are also reviewed. As such, the paper presents a broad overview of the various aspects that constitute a service-based asset management strategy for WDS. The advantages and limitations of different methods and approaches to the various aspects are also compared to assist selection of an appropriate tool. An overview of future research needs related to asset management and interdependence is presented.

            Seismic risk of urban areas around the world is a major concern to stakeholders due to the potential losses of lives and extensive damage to infrastructure that can occur following an earthquake. As risk mitigation resources are limited, a method for assessing risk and prioritizing structures for seismic retrofit at a city or regional scale is required. Scenario-based seismic damage prediction can be used by decision-makers for identifying the riskiest structures that can be prioritized for risk mitigation to optimize the use of available resources. In this case study, for the first time, seismic damage estimation is performed for Sylhet City Corporation (SCC), Bangladesh by integrating Risk Assessment tools for Diagnosis of Urban areas against Seismic disasters (RADIUS) and Geophysical Information System (GIS). Building structures, infrastructure, and soil type information for SCC from a recent study performed by the local government under the framework of the Comprehensive Disaster Management Program (CDMP) are used. The building inventory and other information in the study area are divided into 1.0 × 1.0 square km grids and the information is mapped into RADIUS. Two scenario earthquakes are chosen to perform damage estimation of existing buildings and infrastructures. The study reveals that the two scenario earthquakes (Mw 8.0 from Dauki Fault and Mw 7.6 from Plate Boundary Fault 2) can result in extensive damage and a high number of casualties in the SCC area. The integrated GIS and RADIUS approach provides useful information for decision making in the seismic risk mitigation plan of the city.

            Seismic performance is obtained for a five-storied reinforced concrete frame building performing non-linear dynamic time history analyses. Performance of the building was obtained as a mean of fragility function of spectral acceleration. Earthquake ground motion records are selected from online source considering local earthquake faults scenario proposed in Comprehensive Disaster Management Program (CDMP) and then scaled to fit with Bangladesh National Building Code (BNBC) 1993 design response spectra. Since the structure is considered as typical reinforced concrete ordinary moment resisting frame located in Bangladesh, mechanical properties and other associated parameters are chosen according to Bangladeshi perspective. Each ground motion spectrum is matched with design code spectrum at fundamental time period of the building. Non-linear static pushover analysis is performed to determine damage states from pushover curve. Four damage states (from slight to collapse) are defined based on simplified assumptions. A set of dynamic time history analyses are carried out in order to obtain probability density function of the displacement demand correspond to different level of ground motions. Cumulative distribution of each associated damage states allows deriving fragility curves. Finally four fragility curves are obtained for four damge grades (slight, moderate, severe and collapse).

            A majority of water mains in North America are made of cast iron (CI). The use of CI pipes in water utility started at the end of the nineteenth century and many of the pipes are still functioning even after their expected lifespan. CI pipelines are susceptible to external and internal corrosion over time, which can significantly affect their mechanical strength and hydraulic performance, and consequently the water distribution system (WDS) reliability. Buried CI water mains have experienced the highest number of failures due to corrosion deterioration over time. Since most of the water pipelines are running underground, physical condition assessment of pipelines in a distributed network is often expensive and time-consuming. Existing research on WDS reliability based on statistical failure prediction methods typically assume a constant failure rate and ignore time-dependent strength change due to corrosion. This paper proposes a framework for modeling the time-dependent mechanical reliability of WDSs with CI pipes. Time-variant failure of pipelines is estimated using fragility analysis that accounts for the decrease in pipeline wall thickness due to the formation of corrosion pit on the pipeline wall. The impact of internal corrosion on hydraulic performance is evaluated using a time-variant roughness model. A hypothetical WDS is used to illustrate the proposed framework. The results of the case study show that pipe corrosion can significantly impact the reliability of a WDS as it ages. For instance, the mechanical reliability of the WDS in the case study dropped from 100% at the initial state to 16.5% at 60 years due to corrosion. The proposed framework links the deterioration of pipeline strength and hydraulic performance with system reliability and can, therefore, form the basis of a reliability-based planning for maintenance and rehabilitation.

            Water Distribution Systems (WDSs) are among the most important infrastructures that are critical for the smooth functioning of communities. However, age-old existing WDSs are progressively at risk in the United States. Since failure in a WDS may affect other interdependent infrastructure and result in high economic consequences, water utilities are more interested in preventing rather than reacting to failure. The current study proposes a decision support framework that employs fuzzy hierarchical inference and network graph analysis to rank the most vulnerable water pipelines considering a set of risk factors and their negative consequences. Fourteen (14) risk factors are identified considering water and road network interdependence. These factors are classified into four main vulnerability indices (strength, hydraulic, environmental, road) and one consequence class in order to evaluate the integrated risk of water mains.  Fuzzy analytical hierarchy process is used to quantify the uncertainty in the risk factors to aid the decision-making process. Network centrality analysis is used to identify the most critical components of the WDS. The final decision is made by combining the outputs from the fuzzy inference and the network centrality analysis. The WDS of Modena, Italy is used to demonstrate the proposed approach.

The impact of internal corrosion on hydraulic performance is evaluated using a time-variant roughness model. A hypothetical WDS is used to illustrate the proposed framework for assessing the system reliability. The results of the case study show that pipe corrosion can significantly impact the reliability of WDS as it ages.  For example, the mechanical reliability decreased from 100% for a new system to around 57% at 90-year age. The proposed framework links the deterioration of pipeline strength and hydraulic performance with system reliability and can, therefore, form the basis of a reliability-based planning for maintenance and rehabilitation.
